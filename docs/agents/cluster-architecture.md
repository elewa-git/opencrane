## Mental Model

OpenCrane runs a **containerised control plane + reconciling operator + per-UserTenant agent pods** in
one Kubernetes cluster. The cluster is built to host **N strictly-isolated customer instances side by
side** — each customer is a **ClusterTenant**, each per-user OpenClaw gateway is a **UserTenant** (see
[Tenancy Model](#tenancy-model--clustertenant-vs-usertenant)). A Helm chart deploys the platform planes
(release-local by default); the operator then creates UserTenant workloads at runtime. Isolation
strength is a per-customer choice (`isolationTier`).

## Tenancy Model — ClusterTenant vs UserTenant

OpenCrane has **two distinct tenant concepts**. Keep them straight. Under the **fixed-wildcard
topology** the platform owns ONE wildcard base domain and every org/user name is **derived** under it
— customers no longer bring their own domain (a vanity domain is an optional overlay, see below):

| Term | What it is | Scope | Domain |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|
| **ClusterTenant** | The **customer / isolation unit (org)** — owns a namespace, a `ResourceQuota`/`LimitRange`, and a compute `isolationTier`. | Cluster-scoped CRD `clustertenants.opencrane.io`. | **Derived** apex `<org>.<base>` under the platform wildcard `*.<base>` (e.g. `acme.weownai.eu`). NOT customer-owned. An optional `vanityDomain` CNAMEd onto that apex is an overlay. |
| **UserTenant** | A **per-user OpenClaw agent gateway** — the workload a person connects to. This is the `Tenant`/openclaw CRD; **"UserTenant" is the canonical name**, "`Tenant`" is the legacy CRD kind in code. | Namespaced CRD `tenant.opencrane.io`, runs inside its ClusterTenant's namespace. | No public host of its own. Users connect through the org host `<org>.<base>`; the identity-routing proxy (in the operator) routes each session to its pod at `openclaw-<user>.<ns>.svc` internally. |

### DNS hierarchy

There are exactly **two platform-owned DNS entries** — a fixed super-operator/opencrane-api host, and one
platform wildcard base — under which every org name is **derived** (one flat DNS tree, not per-customer
domains). There are **no per-user subdomains**:

```
platform.weownai.eu             → control plane (the FIXED super-operator host)   [platform-owned, distinct]
*.weownai.eu                    → resolves every ORG HOST                          [platform wildcard, set once at install]
  acme.weownai.eu               → ClusterTenant "acme" — all acme users connect here [explicit A record via external-dns]
  globex.weownai.eu             → ClusterTenant "globex" — all globex users connect here

  ai.client-company.com         → OPTIONAL customer-vanity domain, CNAMEd by the customer onto acme.weownai.eu
```

The identity-routing proxy (folded into the ClusterTenant operator) receives all gateway WebSocket
upgrades at `<org>.<base>`, resolves each user's session via `GET /api/v1/auth/gateway-resolve` on the
control plane, and reverse-proxies to the correct pod at `openclaw-<user>.<ns>.svc` inside the cluster.
UserTenant pods are **not** exposed on their own public host.

- **Control plane** → the **fixed super-operator host** (`ingress.controlPlaneHost`, defaults to
  `platform.<base>`). It is one management API above every org — a distinct host, **never** an org under
  `*.<base>`. Wired by `opencrane-api-ingress.yaml`.
- **Org host** → an explicit `<org>.<base>` A record emitted by the operator as an external-dns
  `DNSEndpoint` at org-provision time; external-dns reconciles it into the zone. Resolved by the platform
  wildcard `*.<base>`.
- **UserTenant routing** → the operator no longer builds per-user Ingress objects. A single wildcard
  Ingress at `*.<base>` routes `/api` to the control plane and the gateway WebSocket path to the
  operator's proxy Service. The proxy does the per-user routing internally.
- **Customer vanity domain** → OPTIONAL. The customer adds a `CNAME` at their own provider pointing
  their domain at the org host `<org>.<base>` (see [DNS config](/operators/dns-config) for the exact
  instruction). The operator issues a per-org HTTP-01 cert carrying the vanity SAN. It is an overlay,
  not the org's identity.

> **Note (June 2026):** the operator derives per-org DNS records via `DefaultOrgDomainProvisioner`
> (`libs/backend/server/cluster-tenants/main/src/core/org-domain.provisioner.ts`); the platform
> cert-manager `Certificate` covers `*.<base>` + apex + the opencrane-api host
> (`cluster-issuer.yaml`); the opencrane-api host is wired by `opencrane-api-ingress.yaml`.
> `*.<base>` matches **org hosts** `<org>.<base>` — one label — which is sufficient because
> there are no per-user subdomains to cover.

## Physical Cluster

- **Cloud target: GKE Autopilot** (`apps/_infra/deploy-k8s/platform/terraform/cloud/gcp/`) — Google-managed nodes, pay-per-pod, private nodes, VPC-native with secondary IP ranges for pods/services, Cloud NAT egress, an install-time Cloud DNS wildcard (`*.<base>`, covering org hosts `<org>.<base>`) pointing at a reserved static global IP. Per-org `<org>.<base>` A records are emitted at runtime by the operator as external-dns `DNSEndpoint` CRs. Provisioned in phases: networking → cluster → Artifact Registry → in-cluster Bitnami PostgreSQL + the chart → DNS.
- **Cloud-agnostic target** (`apps/_infra/deploy-k8s/platform/terraform/core/`) — assumes a ready kubeconfig and applies only the chart; works on k3d (local dev/e2e), EKS, AKS, on-prem. `hosting.provider: onprem` makes cloud storage/identity no-ops.

## Helm Template Inventory

The per-silo `opencrane-silo` chart at `apps/_infra/deploy-k8s` is a composer, not the
anonymous owner of its workloads. `templates/app-rollups.yaml` includes app-owned Helm
library units with the parent release context; shared labels and topology helpers remain in
`apps/_infra/deploy-k8s/platform/templates/_helpers.tpl`.

| Owner | Creates |
|-------|---------|
| `apps/opencrane/helm` | Control-plane Deployment, Service, Ingress/certificate, SA/RBAC, gateway-proxy Service, and server NetworkPolicy |
| `apps/postgres/helm` | CNPG Cluster, clean `initdb` baseline reference, logical Database resources, backup/recovery, and database-privileges Job |
| `apps/opencrane-ui/helm` | Optional administration SPA Deployment and Service |
| `apps/_infra/cognee/helm` | Cognee Deployment, Service, PVC, identity, probes, and NetworkPolicy |
| `apps/_infra/litellm/helm` | LiteLLM Deployment, Service, credential Secret contract, and non-token identity |
| `apps/_infra/obot/helm` | Obot gateway Deployment, Service, KSA/RBAC, and NetworkPolicy |
| `apps/_infra/langfuse` | Pinned upstream chart ownership for web, worker, ClickHouse, ZooKeeper, Valkey, and MinIO workload classes |
| `apps/artifact-service/helm` | Canonical ArtifactStore byte service: RWO expandable PVC, private service, and no catalog authority |
| `apps/agent-controller/helm` | Outbound-only controller in the server namespace; dedicated restricted runtime namespace, zero-RBAC runtime identity, exact Job create/release and first-Pod list RBAC, fixed network floor, and fail-closed Job admission |
| `apps/_infra/deploy-k8s/templates/{cluster-issuer,external-secrets-store,networkpolicy-*}.yaml` | Issuer/external-secret composition and cross-plane/default-deny policy |

The machine-enforced inventory is `docs/agents/workload-ownership.json`; adding a pod class
without an exact owner or direct deletion decision fails `scripts/phase-b-topology.sh`.

## The Planes, Wired

All planes are **ClusterIP-only** (no external LB) — external traffic arrives through Ingress. Internal DNS is `<release>-<plane>.<namespace>.svc`. Each plane is independently release-local (`instance`) or `shared` via `values.yaml` (`sharedPlatform.*`).

- **operator** → Kubernetes API only. Watches Tenant/AccessPolicy/ClusterTenant CRs and injects
  the other planes' URLs into tenant pods. Deep-dive: [`apps/opencrane.md`](./apps/opencrane.md).
- **opencrane-api** (`:8080`) → Postgres + K8s API + Cognee + LiteLLM. The hub everything else talks to. Deep-dive: [`apps/opencrane.md`](./apps/opencrane.md).
- **mcp-gateway / Obot** (`:8080`) → holds downstream MCP credentials and executes MCP tools;
  tenant pods reach MCP servers through it (projected token `aud=obot-gateway`). OpenCrane remains
  the catalog/grant authority; the removed registry-poll route is not a synchronization mechanism.
- **artifact-service** (`:8080`) → owns only content-addressed artifact bytes on its mounted PVC. It runs in the release's dedicated `<release>-artifacts` namespace with the receipt-signing key; OpenCrane remains the catalog and authorization authority in the control namespace, holds only the lease signer, and tenant/runtime pods never mount the volume.
- **agent-controller** → owns no listener. It claims desired attempts from OpenCrane, exactly creates
  or adopts their suspended Job in a Helm-owned dedicated runtime namespace, reports the Kubernetes
  Job UID, then separately
  claims the durable release. Release is one conditional patch fenced by Job UID, resource version,
  and `suspend=true`; the controller lists only exact Job-owned Pod candidates and registers the
  unique first Pod. It cannot delete or watch, read Secrets, create NetworkPolicies, or mutate Pods.
  The runtime namespace enforces Pod Security Standards `restricted`, default-deny networking, fixed
  OpenCrane-and-DNS egress, and a release-specific ValidatingAdmissionPolicy for the exact Job shape.
- **litellm** (`:4000`) → the only LLM egress path for tenant pods; operator mints a per-tenant virtual key Secret; enforces budget.

## Namespace Model

**Single-install (default):** one release namespace holds the server-side planes. Personal-runtime
Jobs and Pods occupy a deterministic sibling `<release>-runtime` namespace containing only their
zero-RBAC ServiceAccount and Helm-owned security policies. CRDs and other RBAC remain scoped by
their owning plane.

**Multi-instance (`multiInstance.enabled: true`):** each customer install gets its own namespace (`oc-acme`, `oc-globex`, …) with its own planes, namespaced RBAC, namespaced cert Issuer/SecretStore, and a default-deny cross-instance NetworkPolicy. CRDs are installed **once** cluster-wide (`--skip-crds` on releases). See [Multi-Instance](#multi-instance-cluster-shape).

**Per-ClusterTenant fencing (when a UserTenant has `clusterTenantRef`):** the operator provisions/uses the parent's bound namespace with a **PSA `baseline`** label, a `ResourceQuota` (cpu/mem/pods/storage/gpu), and a `LimitRange` (per-container defaults — required because the quota constrains `requests.*`). `baseline` (not `restricted`) because silos run 3rd-party planes — Obot ships an embedded root Postgres with no `USER`, Cognee runs as root, Langfuse subcharts — that cannot satisfy `restricted`; `baseline` still blocks privileged containers, host namespaces, `hostPath`, and host ports. Tightening to `restricted` behind a leaner non-root gateway is tracked as a security follow-up.

## Network Topology

- **Ingress:** GCE Ingress (GCP) or ingress-nginx (on-prem). The **control plane** is reached on the **fixed super-operator host** (`ingress.controlPlaneHost`, default `platform.<base>`); org hosts `<org>.<base>` are resolved by the platform wildcard `*.<base>` and routed via a single wildcard Ingress to the operator's identity-routing proxy (gateway WebSocket) and the control plane (API). There are no per-user Ingress objects. See [Tenancy Model](#tenancy-model--clustertenant-vs-usertenant).
- **App-owned NetworkPolicies** restrict ArtifactStore ingress to the OpenCrane server only across the control-to-artifact namespace boundary; its PVC is mounted only in the artifact-service pod. Server RBAC is namespaced to its explicit control/tenant namespaces and cannot read the artifact namespace receipt signer. The server's `/api/internal/*` listener remains separately protected by its own policy and is never internet-routable.
- **Personal-runtime NetworkPolicies** default-deny the whole dedicated runtime namespace and admit
  only runtime Pod egress to the exact OpenCrane internal port in the server namespace plus cluster
  DNS. The controller remains in the server namespace and has its own explicit OpenCrane/API/DNS
  egress policy.
- **Tenant egress** is default-DNS + the CIDR/FQDN allow-lists compiled from the tenant's AccessPolicy (standard NetworkPolicy always; optional CiliumNetworkPolicy for FQDN filtering).
- **TLS:** one **platform** cert (`*.<base>` + apex + opencrane-api host), issued via cert-manager DNS-01. It covers every org host `<org>.<base>`. A per-org HTTP-01 cert is issued only when a `vanityDomain` is set on the ClusterTenant. The platform cert is rendered by the chart; per-org vanity certs by the cluster-tenants operator. There are no per-org wildcard certs.

### TLS certificates

Because users connect to their org at `<org>.<base>` — a single label under the platform wildcard — the
platform `*.<base>` cert covers every org host. No per-org wildcard cert is needed:

| Cert | Covers | Challenge | Issued by |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Platform** `*.<base>` (+ `<base>` + opencrane-api host) | every org host `<org>.<base>`, the apex, the fixed opencrane-api host | DNS-01 (wildcard requires DNS-01) | the chart (`cluster-issuer.yaml`) at install |
| **Per-org vanity** (SAN = customer vanity host) | the vanity host only, e.g. `ai.client-company.com` | HTTP-01 | the cluster-tenants operator at org-provision, only when `vanityDomain` is set |

The control plane persists the org and hands off to the operator, which calls the
[`OrgDomainProvisioner`](#org-provisioning-hand-off) seam to emit the org's DNS record and, when a
vanity domain is present, the HTTP-01 cert. The platform wildcard cert is issued once by the chart and
auto-renewed; it requires no per-org action.

### Org provisioning hand-off

When an org is created (`POST /api/v1/cluster-tenants`), the control plane persists desired state and
hands off the cluster-side side effects to the ClusterTenant operator/CR watcher. The interface the
reconciler calls is `OrgDomainProvisioner.provisionOrgDomain(...)`
(`libs/backend/server/cluster-tenants/main/src/core/org-domain-provisioner.types.ts`), implemented by
`DefaultOrgDomainProvisioner` (`libs/backend/server/cluster-tenants/main/src/core/org-domain.provisioner.ts`):
it **declares** the explicit `<org>.<base>` A record as a namespaced external-dns `DNSEndpoint` custom
resource (`externaldns.k8s.io/v1alpha1`); the external-dns controller reconciles it into whatever DNS
provider the platform runs (Cloud DNS, Route53, …) — no cloud SDK in the operator. When a `vanityDomain`
is set it additionally issues an HTTP-01 `Certificate` carrying the vanity SAN. Both side effects are
idempotent. It is **fail-closed + runtime-gated by real capability detection**: when the cluster has no
cert-manager and no external-dns, it returns `{ready:false, skipped:true}` and never crashes, while the
resource-authoring path stays real. The create path itself never mutates DNS or cert-manager — only the
reconciler (in the operator) does (fail-closed, API-first).

## Isolation Tiers

`ClusterTenantIsolationTier` (`libs/contracts/src/cluster-tenant.types.ts`) determines cluster placement:

| Tier | Cluster shape | Status |
|------|---------------|--------|
| `shared` | Namespace on bin-packed shared nodes; ResourceQuota caps the customer. | ✅ Built |
| `dedicatedNodes` | Namespace + a tainted node pool; operator stamps `nodeSelector`+`tolerations` (from `compute.mode=dedicated`, `compute.nodePool`). | ✅ Built |
| `dedicatedCluster` | Customer gets its own kube-apiserver via an **external provisioner** (webhook seam, AGPL-clean; Kamaji-shaped). | ⏸️ **Parked** — opencrane-api validates and rejects with `422 TIER_UNAVAILABLE` unless a provisioner is registered. |

The provisioner seam is currently limited to the built-in shared provisioner. A future external
provisioner must establish a workload-identity contract before it is introduced.

## Multi-Instance Cluster Shape

`multiInstance.enabled` flips these safety defaults (conformance-tested statically by `apps/_infra/deploy-k8s/platform/tests/multi-instance-conformance.sh`):

| Concern | Single-install | Multi-instance |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Operator/opencrane-api RBAC | `ClusterRole`/`ClusterRoleBinding` | namespaced `Role`/`RoleBinding` per instance |
| Operator watch scope | `WATCH_NAMESPACE=""` (all) | scoped + **fail-closed** if unset (`REQUIRE_WATCH_NAMESPACE`) |
| CRDs | installed with the release | installed once cluster-wide, `--skip-crds` on releases |
| cert Issuer / SecretStore | `ClusterIssuer` / `ClusterSecretStore` | namespaced `Issuer` / `SecretStore` |
| Cross-instance traffic | n/a | default-deny NetworkPolicy, same-instance allow only |

## Workload Identity

- **Cloud (GKE):** operator's SA carries `iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: …`; GKE exchanges the projected K8s token for a GSA access token so the operator can provision GCS buckets without static creds. On-prem this is absent.
- **In-cluster (tenant pods):** up to three audience-bound projected SA tokens mounted read-only under `/var/run/opencrane/tokens/` — `aud=obot-gateway|feat-skill-registry|opencrane-server`, kubelet-rotated (`projectedTokenTtlSeconds`). Each receiving plane validates the audience via TokenReview. These tokens are never exposed to a browser.

## CRDs

Three CRDs are rendered from `apps/_infra/deploy-k8s/templates/crds/`, all in `opencrane.io`:

| CRD | Group | Scope |
|-----|-------|-------|
| `Tenant` (the **UserTenant**) | `opencrane.io` | Namespaced — the per-user OpenClaw agent-gateway. "UserTenant" is the canonical name; the CRD kind is still `Tenant`. |
| `AccessPolicy` | `opencrane.io` | Namespaced — egress/MCP/dataset policy. |
| `ClusterTenant` | `opencrane.io` | **Cluster-scoped** — the customer/isolation unit. |

All use `spec`/`status` subresources: spec is user/opencrane-api-owned, status is operator-owned.
